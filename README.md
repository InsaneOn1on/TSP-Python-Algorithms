# Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) Algorithms  

## By Alex Kendall  

### Project Overview  
This repository contains python implementation for the following approches:  

1. **Brute Force** – Searches all possible routes to find the shortest path.  
2. **Nearest Neighbor** – A greedy heuristic that selects the closest unvisited city at each step.  
3. **Held-Karp (Dynamic Programming)** – An optimized approach using memoization to solve TSP in **O(n² · 2ⁿ)** time complexity.  

### Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **NumPy**  
- **itertools** (for permutations in brute-force)  
- **functools** (for memoization in Held-Karp)
